# OUCRU Malaria Sim v3.0.2

"OUCRU Malaria Sim" is an individual-based microsimulation of malaria transmission developed in C++.

This version of the simulation includes transmission between hosts (without explicit implementation of mosquitoes), within-host parasite development, multi-clonal infections in hosts, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, mutation to multiple types of drug-resistant genotypes, 


program for modeling malaria epidemiology and the longterm impacts of a population-scaled treatment strategy against antimalarial resistance. The results of the simulation are used in the "Optimal population‚Äêlevel deployment of artemisinin combination therapies" published in Lancet Global Heath July 2015.
